I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Tamás Kovácsházy, for his support and guidance during the time of this project and the my whole university journey. With his help on this project I was able to venture into a fascinating field of study that very much piqued my interest despite being relatively new.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all my friends who supported me through ups and downs while enrolled in this master's degree program.
