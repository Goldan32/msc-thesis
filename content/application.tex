\chapter{Example Application}

In this chapter I will showcase the development of an example project that aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the selected multicore microcontroller and the Rust programming language. I will highlight features that are plain better from most perspectives, as well as the areas where this approach falls short compared to a traditional C project.
